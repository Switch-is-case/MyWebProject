Interactive Web Project
This project is an interactive, user-friendly web application featuring a clean design and several functional elements. It integrates responsive UI components with Bootstrap and JavaScript for an engaging user experience. Users can explore a FAQ section, toggle between light and dark modes, send messages with notifications, and enjoy time-based greetings.

Key Features
1. FAQs Section
A dynamic FAQ section answers common questions, helping users find information quickly.
2. Light/Dark Mode
Users can switch between light and dark modes.
Preferences are saved in local storage, so the theme persists even after a page reload or revisiting the site.
3. Message Notifications
When a user sends me a message, I receive a notification to ensure that I am kept up to date with all incoming messages in real time.
4. Dynamic Date, Time, and Greetings
Displays the current date and time, with a personalized greeting (e.g., "Good Morning," "Good Afternoon," or "Good Evening") based on the time of day.
5. "Read More" Button
Content previews with a "Read More" button allow users to expand text sections, keeping the layout clean while offering additional information on demand.
6. Bootstrap Integration
The project uses Bootstrap for a responsive layout, featuring elements like:
Grid for structured content arrangement.
Carousel for image or content slideshows.
Navbar for intuitive navigation.
Card components to showcase content with a clean, organized look.
7. Navigation with Keyboard Accessibility
A custom keydown event for the navigation enhances accessibility, allowing keyboard navigation through the menu.

This application uses local storage to manage user preferences, like the selected theme (light/dark mode), ensuring a personalized experience each time users visit.
